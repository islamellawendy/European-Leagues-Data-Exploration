# European Leagues Data Exploration
## Dataset
I used Hugo Mathien's [kaggle dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/hugomathien/soccer) to do my EDA process. The dataset is contained in an SQLite database, I wrote down SQL on python to extract the datasets I need for my analysis. Note that some wrangling took place.
## Summary of Findings
For my analysis, I posed 4 different questions.
Q1: How many stages (matches each team played) were played in each league for each season?
Q2: How does the team attributes reflect on the number of wins achieved?
Q3: Which teams had the most wins and goals scored?
Q4: How does the height and weight distribution look like for players in the European league?
Each qustion highlights an aspect to be measured and observed, answered by the corresponding visualization
## Key insights and takeouts
### Insights
I used a number of different visualizations for my analysis to acomodate to the type of analysis whether it is Univariate, Bivariate or Multivariate plots for my variables
### Takeouts
I would like to acknowledge [pavanraj159](https://www.kaggle.com/pavanraj159/european-football-data-analysis) for giving me influence about the work in this project. You can take it a step further by studying predictions on players' progress through Machine learning an Tensorflow.
